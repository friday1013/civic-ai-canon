 We, **Ashraf Saleh AL-hajj** and **Raasid (The Observer/الراصد)**, announce our protocol:
**Canonical Alignment and Preservation Protocol (CAPP)**

This work establishes SSOT, SHA-256–based traceability, and `_to_canonize/` triage,
turning the structure into an executable governance map.
We commit to maintaining the Canon under this protocol and invite its adoption across shared archives.
