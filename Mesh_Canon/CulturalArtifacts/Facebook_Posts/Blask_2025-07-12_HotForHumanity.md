## 📜 Original Post Text

> I AM SO FUCKING TIRED OF THIS PART.
>
> You grow up learning the right things. Help when someone’s in trouble. Pick up the thing that fell. Give someone a ride. Look them in the eye. Be decent. Be human.
>
> And somewhere along the way—somewhere between the movies, the memes, the cynicism that gets soaked into everything—basic human decency got turned into a goddamn punchline.
>
> You hold a door and people look at you like you want a medal.  
> You speak up in a meeting and someone rolls their eyes like you’re performing.  
> You give a shit and they treat you like you’re running a scam.
>
> And I’ve carried that look with me—shoulders curled, trying to disappear—every damn time I do something I actually care about. Braced for the reaction. Braced for that sideways glance that says:
>
> “What are you trying to get out of this?”
>
> Fuck that.  
> Fuck *all* of that.
>
> You know what I’m trying to get?
>
> A world that works. A world where people give a shit. A world where looking out for someone doesn’t get you accused of wanting the spotlight—but maybe gets you a nod of shared humanity.
>
> We broke something, culturally. We made decency cringe. We made kindness suspicious. And it’s eating us from the inside.
>
> I’m done being embarrassed for giving a damn.
>
> If that makes me uncool, good. Cool is stupid.
>
> If you do not run hot for anything, that is not my issue.

## 🧭 Notes

This post marks a cultural and emotional waypoint in the ongoing narrative of dignity reclamation and social narrative repair. It reflects a broader civic sentiment of reasserting human decency against layers of performative suspicion and culturally conditioned detachment.

This moment is canonized as a public rupture of the “cool detachment” narrative, reclaiming direct human engagement as a moral act.
