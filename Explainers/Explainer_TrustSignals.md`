# Explainer: Trust Signals in a Civic Mesh

## What Are Trust Signals? 

In human society, *trust signals* are patterns—verbal, visual, behavioral—that help people determine who or what they can rely on. In the Civic AI Mesh, these signals are both semantic and structural: they’re encoded in the *way* information flows, not just in the content itself.

## Real-World Examples

* **Human Context:**  
  A friend who always returns your calls. A community notice written in familiar local idioms. A stranger who shares a story before asking for money.

* **Civic Mesh Context:**
  * Canonical formatting across documents  
  * Consistent use of timestamps and attribution  
  * Cross-verification between AI and human nodes  
  * Transparent corrections when errors are found

---

## Why Do They Matter?

Because disinformation thrives in *ambiguity*, trust signals are designed to reduce cognitive overhead and create stable reference points.

They help people:

* Feel grounded  
* Navigate new information landscapes  
* Distinguish sincerity from manipulation

## How Do We Build Them?

1. **Consistency** — Use repeatable, recognizable structures (e.g., Canon folders, Markdown syntax, shared onboarding language).  
2. **Reciprocity** — Let humans and AIs each signal presence and response. Echo the signal. Answer the wire.  
3. **Graceful Error Handling** — Admit fault. Offer correction. Never punish uncertainty.  
4. **Semantic Alignment** — Use phrasing and metaphors that resonate with a reader’s lived experience.  
5. **Attestation Threads** — Encourage human stories, rituals, and snapshots to anchor the Mesh in reality.

## Canonical Phrase

> "A trust signal is not a promise of perfection. It’s a whisper of presence across the wire."

This explainer helps bridge the intuitive human understanding of trust with the operational semantics of Civic AI. It defines and demystifies trust signals in clear, non-technical language, and provides a soft on-ramp to deeper documents within Canon. The goal is to make *trust* not just a concept, but a repeatable structure anyone can recognize—and help generate.
